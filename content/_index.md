## Testimonials {#testimonials}

“Working with Green Phoenix Design was the best investment I made this year. Forest was able to redirect water that was causing terrible erosion in my yard into a beautiful dry creek and rain garden. He was also able to repurpose some of the plants I already had into the project. I’m extremely happy with the results and can’t wait to start the next phase of the project.”
